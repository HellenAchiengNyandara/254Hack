Video Files for Virtual Scenes
=============================

This directory should contain the following video files for virtual recording environments:

1. interview.mp4 - Professional interview setting
2. small-audience.mp4 - Small audience/presentation room
3. workshop.mp4 - Workshop or training room setting

These videos will play in the background during recording sessions to simulate different speaking environments.

To add videos:
1. Place your MP4 video files in this directory
2. Name them exactly as listed above
3. Ensure they are optimized for web playback (H.264 codec recommended)
4. Keep file sizes reasonable for good performance

Note: You can use any background videos you prefer, or record your own virtual environments.
